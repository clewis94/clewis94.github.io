    <section>
      <h3><a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank">Stripe</a></h3>
      <p>Stripe is an online payment platform with a clean and professional homepage that demonstrates how to follow CRAP design principles effectively.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Dark text on light backgrounds and bright accent colors make the website clear.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Consistent fonts, buttons, and spacing help establish a sense of unity throughout the site.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Everything is grid based, aligned neatly, giving it a polished and balanced look.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related information such as the feature lists are grouped well, reducing clutter and helping users find what they need.</li>
      </ul>

    <section>
      <h3><a href="https://www.pnwx.com/" target="_blank">Pacific Northwest X-Ray</a></h3>
      <p>Pacific Northwest X-Ray is a medical supplier website that has a cluttered design with too many competing elements and colors, making it hard to focus on important information.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Overdone bright, flashing colors compete instead of guiding the eye.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Inconsistent design elements clash rather than reinforce a theme.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Poor text, images, and banners feel scattered with no clear grid.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> It is too much packed together with little spacing, making it hard to read and separate each section.</li>
      </ul>
